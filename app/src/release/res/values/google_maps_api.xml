    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=D3:4D:C3:31:90:FF:72:C6:52:CF:49:DE:E6:14:B9:A7:31:2E:B4:9B%3Bcom.buscacole

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    D3:4D:C3:31:90:FF:72:C6:52:CF:49:DE:E6:14:B9:A7:31:2E:B4:9B;com.buscacole

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
    -->
    <string name="google_maps_key" translatable="false" templateMergeStrategy="preserve">
        YOUR_KEY_HERE
    </string>
